        <p>Hello, My name is Drake Ngesa. I was born in Mombasa County and named after the 15th century pirate Sir Francis Drake. I graduated from Strathmore School in the year 2014 and immediately got employed as a back-end administrator at Zetu Kenya Ltd.</p>
        <p>My contract with Zetu Kenya Ltd. expired in early 2015 and I began to trade forex shortly thereafter. After experiencing marginal success in the money markets, I decided to diversify my portfolio and began to trade bitcoin as well. After a few profitable years in both markets, I decided to take a break towards the tail end of 2019.</p>
        <h2>Why am I learning to program?</h2>
        <p>I am learning to program because the speed of technological advancement is increasing at an unprecedented rate and humans are becoming more and more reliant on technology and technology based solutions. I believe that a comprehensive education in programming will allow me to create futureproof solutions to problems that have not been infiltrated by technology to the fullest potential yet and such skills will also give me the ability to further improve on available solutions in the market.</p>
        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I am an avid fan of various motorsports. Namely:
                <ul>
                    <li>Formula 1</li>
                    <li>Formula Drift</li>
                    <li>WRC (World Rally Championship)</li>
                </ul>
                I do enjoy watching the races as well as watching personal battles unfold on the race track.</li>
            <li>I am an even bigger fan of European football and in addition to watching every available game, I especially follow all the exploits of my favourite team, Arsenal Football Club. I also pride myself in being able to play the game as well.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy cooking! I believe that nothing brings people closer together like a good meal and being able to make an exceptional meal brings me great joy</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
        <p>My drive to constistently improve in every facet of life is fueled by Nike. The brand's brilliant commercials as well as the personalities they endorse are a constant reminder that greatness lies with us and the keys to achieving excellence are hardwork and sacrifice.</p>
